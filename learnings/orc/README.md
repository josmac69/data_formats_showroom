# ORC data format

ChatGPT4:

Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) is a columnar storage file format developed by the Apache Hive community to provide better compression, faster query performance, and efficient storage for Hadoop-based big data processing systems. It is designed to optimize the reading, writing, and processing of data in the Hadoop ecosystem.

#### Advantages of ORC:

1. **Compression**: ORC format uses lightweight compression algorithms like Zlib or Snappy, which provide better storage efficiency compared to other formats. Columnar storage, combined with lightweight compression and encoding techniques, significantly reduces the storage footprint of the data.

2. **Performance**: ORC format is optimized for query performance, as it supports predicate pushdown, column pruning, and skip indexes. These optimizations reduce the amount of data that needs to be read during query execution, resulting in faster query performance.

3. **Type-aware encoding**: ORC format uses type-aware encoding schemes for each data type, which further improves compression and query performance. For instance, integers are encoded using lightweight compression techniques like run-length encoding or delta encoding, while strings use dictionary encoding.

4. **Schema evolution**: ORC format supports schema evolution, allowing users to add, delete, or modify columns without having to rewrite the entire dataset. This provides flexibility in adapting to changing data structures and schema requirements.

5. **ACID transactions**: ORC format can be used with Apache Hive's ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) transaction support, enabling users to perform update and delete operations on data stored in ORC files.

#### Disadvantages of ORC:

1. **Write performance**: While ORC format is optimized for read performance, it can be slower for write-heavy workloads compared to row-based formats like Avro or JSON. This is because ORC needs to compress and encode data during the write process, which may increase the write latency.

2. **Ecosystem support**: Although ORC format is widely supported in the Hadoop ecosystem, it might not be as well-supported in non-Hadoop systems or some third-party big data tools compared to other formats like Parquet or Avro.

#### Typical use cases for ORC:

1. **Data warehousing and analytics**: ORC format is well-suited for data warehousing and analytics workloads that require high query performance and efficient storage, especially in the Hadoop ecosystem.

2. **Columnar-based data processing**: ORC format is ideal for use cases where queries predominantly access only a subset of columns in the dataset, as it can take advantage of column pruning and predicate pushdown optimizations.

3. **Data storage with schema evolution**: If your use case requires handling evolving data structures and schemas, ORC format can be an appropriate choice, as it supports schema evolution without the need for rewriting the entire dataset.

In summary, ORC is a columnar storage format that provides better compression, faster query performance, and efficient storage for big data processing systems, especially within the Hadoop ecosystem. It is well-suited for data warehousing and analytics workloads that require high query performance and efficient storage. However, it might not be the best choice for write-heavy workloads or for use cases where extensive support in non-Hadoop systems is required.
