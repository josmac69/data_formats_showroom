# Parquet data file - schema evolution

Yes, Apache Parquet, a columnar storage file format optimized for use with big data processing frameworks, supports schema evolution. This allows you to modify the schema over time without breaking compatibility between readers and writers using different schema versions.

Parquet's schema evolution support includes the following capabilities:

* Adding columns: You can add new columns to an existing schema. Older data files that do not have the new columns can still be read by new readers, which will fill in the missing values with nulls or the specified default values. New data files with the additional columns can also be read by old readers, which will ignore the new columns during deserialization.

* Removing columns: You can remove columns from the schema. Older data files containing the removed columns can still be read by new readers, but the removed columns will be ignored during deserialization. New data files without the removed columns can be read by old readers, which will treat the missing columns as having all null values.

* Renaming columns: Parquet readers rely on column names for schema resolution. If you rename a column in the schema, you can use an alias in the reader's schema to map the old column name to the new column name. This allows the reader to correctly deserialize data files with the old column name.

* Modifying column types: Parquet supports limited type modification when evolving the schema. You can change a column's type between compatible types, such as widening numeric types (e.g., from int32 to int64), or converting between date and time representations. However, you cannot change a column's type to a completely different, incompatible type (e.g., from int32 to string).

It's essential to thoroughly test any schema changes to ensure that both new and old readers and writers can handle the evolved schema correctly. By following the best practices for schema evolution in Parquet, you can modify your schema over time without breaking compatibility between different versions of your applications or data.
