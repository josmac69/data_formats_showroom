# Parquet data format

Parquet is a columnar storage file format optimized for use with big data processing frameworks like Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Impala. It was developed by Cloudera and Twitter and is now an open-source project under the Apache Software Foundation. Parquet is designed to be highly efficient in terms of storage, I/O, and query performance, making it a popular choice for big data and analytics use cases.

### Detailed Description:

* Columnar Storage: Parquet stores data in a columnar format, which means that data for each column is stored together, rather than the row-based storage used in traditional relational databases. Columnar storage enables better compression and reduces I/O overhead, as it allows reading only the required columns during query execution, rather than reading entire rows.

* Compression: Parquet supports various compression algorithms, including Snappy, Gzip, LZO, and Brotli. Since similar data is stored together in a columnar format, Parquet can achieve better compression ratios compared to row-based formats. This reduces storage costs and improves query performance by minimizing I/O.

* Schema Evolution: Parquet supports schema evolution, allowing users to add, remove, or modify columns in the schema without having to rewrite or convert the entire dataset. This is particularly useful in big data scenarios, where datasets can be large and evolving the schema can be time-consuming.

* Encoding: Parquet uses various encoding techniques to optimize storage and query performance. Examples include dictionary encoding, run-length encoding (RLE), and delta encoding. These encoding techniques help reduce the storage footprint and improve query performance by reducing I/O and CPU overhead.

* Type Support: Parquet supports a wide range of data types, including complex nested structures like maps, arrays, and structs. This makes Parquet suitable for storing semi-structured and structured data.

### Examples and Use Cases:

* Data Warehousing: Parquet is an excellent choice for data warehousing use cases, where analytical queries often access only a small subset of columns. With its columnar storage format and compression capabilities, Parquet can significantly improve query performance and reduce storage costs.

* Machine Learning: In machine learning applications, data is often read and processed column-wise. Parquet's columnar storage format makes it an ideal choice for storing large datasets used in machine learning applications, as it allows efficient reading and processing of specific columns.

* Log and Event Data Storage: Parquet can be used to store large volumes of log and event data generated by applications, IoT devices, or web servers. Its support for complex nested data structures allows it to store semi-structured data efficiently, while its compression capabilities help reduce storage costs.

* Data Lake: In a data lake architecture, data from various sources is stored in its raw format for further processing and analysis. Parquet can be used as the storage format for structured and semi-structured data in a data lake, as it offers high performance, efficient storage, and schema evolution capabilities.

For example, let's say you have a large dataset containing customer information, including demographics and purchase history. Using Parquet, you can store this data in a columnar format, enabling efficient querying and processing of specific columns (e.g., age, gender, or total purchases) without having to read the entire dataset. The data can be compressed to save storage space and improve query performance. Additionally, if new columns need to be added to the dataset, Parquet's schema evolution support allows you to do this without having to rewrite or convert the entire dataset.

In summary, Parquet is a columnar storage file format that offers numerous benefits, such as efficient storage, high query performance, and schema evolution support. It is widely used in big data and analytics use cases, including data warehousing, machine learning, log
